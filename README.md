# Polynomial Application

This C application allows users to create and manipulate polynomials using linked lists to connect terms. Users can evaluate polynomials, add or delete nodes (polynomial terms) in the linked list. The program ensures successful removal of nodes upon termination, utilizes typedef and multi-file settings to enhance organization and readability. It adheres to strict coding conventions and practices as set by Prof. Tuan Nguyen of Laney College, Oakland CA. This project serves as the final assignment for CIS 27 Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2023 at Laney College, Oakland CA.
